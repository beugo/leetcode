    Problem: Find all indices in str1 such that removing the character at that
    index makes str1 equal to str2. If no such index exists, return [-1].

    Example:
    str1 = "abc", str2 = "ab"
    â†’ Removable index = [2] (removing 'c')

    Approach:
    - Compare characters of str1 and str2 from left to right.
    - On the first mismatch, try skipping the character at str1[i].
    - If the remainder matches, record i as removable.
    - Additionally, if str1 matches str2 up to the end, then the last
      character of str1 is also removable.
    - Return all such indices, or [-1] if none exist.
