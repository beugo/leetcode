    Problem: Count the number of contiguous segments of length m in the list s
    such that the sum of each segment equals d.
    
    Example:
    s = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2], d = 3, m = 2
    Valid segments: [1, 2], [2, 1] â†’ Output = 2
    
    Approach:
    - Use a sliding window of size m across the list.
    - Keep track of the current window sum.
    - For each step, update the window sum in O(1) by adding the new element
      and removing the oldest element.
    - Count how many times the sum equals d.
    
    Complexity:
    - O(n) time (single pass with window updates).
    - O(1) extra space.
